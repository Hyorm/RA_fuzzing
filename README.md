# RA_fuzzing(20-1 Research Internship)
fuzzing algorithm, C with fuzzing book<br>

## Summary
I performed the task of changing the **python code** of the **fuzzing book(<https://www.fuzzingbook.org/>)** to the **C language**.
This process allows me to learn the fuzzing algorithm.
The code of the fuzzing book is implemented as an object-oriented algorithm, so I overcomed the limitations of the c language using the structure of the c language.
After completing this process, I conducted a fuzzing test using Google/fuzzer-test-suite with anora, AFL, and libfuzzer and performed a comparative analysis of the differences and performance of each fuzzer.
The comparison data will be uploaded later.
